'Changing the way you share', giving you an experience you have never had before...

== Description ==

WP-Thumbnail is a simple and neat Wordpress Plugin that not only allows you to use a short-code to generate dynamic 
screenshot of webpages in your posts but also takes a realtime snapshot of the served webpage and saves a link to it 
on the page itself that too without burdening the servers. This helps in optimizing search results on Google by adding
a thumbnail to the left of the search result snippet and makes shared posts more attractive, with a relevant thumbnails,
on Social Sites like Facebook.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the shortcode is not working and refreshing? =

It works in all cases. The possible problem is that you are not using 'http' or 'https' protocols.

= Why there is no thumbnail on Google Searches? =

The Google bots take sometime to refresh the contents. I depends on your site status. I might take a day or a month.

= Why I shows-up generating the preview image on Facebook? =

I may happen sometime because Facebook script is delicate and 'sometimes' time-out before the rendering (seen on slow connections).
